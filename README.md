## Description

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis):

> Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the data from a given dataset (e.g. an eCommerce platform, web application, or online game) and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span. Cohort analysis allows a company to â€œsee patterns clearly across the life-cycle of a customer (or user), rather than slicing across all customers blindly without accounting for the natural cycle that a customer undergoes.

## usage

 - The **total** metric is the value that determine y-axis. Can be either a count or a sum. It also possible to use the percentual as y value just marking the option `Show percetual values`.
 - The **cohort date** bucket is the date used to draw the chart lines. Each bucket is a line in this chart. It should be a date histogram.
 - The **cohort period** bucket is the "cohort" itself that determine the x-axis. It should be a numeric histogram.
